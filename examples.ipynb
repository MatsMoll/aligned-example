You define your features using methods and operators available in the framework. Here are a few examples to demonstrate how to compute features:\\n\\n1. Compute arithmetic features:\\n\\n```python\\nclass ArithmeticFeatures(FeatureView):\\n    metadata = FeatureView.metadata_with(\\n        name=\\\"arithmetic_features\\\",\\n        description=\\\"Demonstration of arithmetic features\\\",\\n        batch_source=my_db.table(\\\"sample_table\\\"),\\n    )\\n\\n    id = Int32().as_entity()\\n\\n    value1 = Float()\\n    value2 = Float()\\n\\n    sum = value1 + value2\\n    difference = value1 - value2\\n    product = value1 * value2\\n    quotient = value1 / value2\\n```\\n\\n2. Compute date features:\\n\\n```python\\nclass DateFeatures(FeatureView):\\n    metadata = FeatureView.metadata_with(\\n        name=\\\"date_features\\\",\\n        description=\\\"Demonstration of date features\\\",\\n        batch_source=my_db.table(\\\"sample_table\\\"),\\n    )\\n\\n    id = Int32().as_entity()\\n\\n    event_timestamp = EventTimestamp()\\n\\n    day_of_week = event_timestamp.date_component(\\\"day\\\").description(\\\"The day of the week\\\")\\n    month = event_timestamp.date_component(\\\"month\\\").description(\\\"The month\\\")\\n    year = event_timestamp.date_component(\\\"year\\\").description(\\\"The year\\\")\\n```\\n\\n3. Compute categorical features:\\n\\n```python\\nclass CategoricalFeatures(FeatureView):\\n    metadata = FeatureView.metadata_with(\\n        name=\\\"categorical_features\\\",\\n        description=\\\"Demonstration of categorical features\\\",\\n        batch_source=my_db.table(\\\"sample_table\\\"),\\n    )\\n\\n    id = Int32().as_entity()\\n\\n    color = String().accepted_values([\\\"red\\\", \\\"blue\\\", \\\"green\\\"])\\n\\n    is_red, is_blue, is_green = color.one_hot_encode([\\\"red\\\", \\\"blue\\\", \\\"green\\\"])\\n```\\n\\n4. Compute geographical features:\\n\\n```python\\nclass GeographicalFeatures(FeatureView):\\n    metadata = FeatureView.metadata_with(\\n        name=\\\"geographical_features\\\",\\n        description=\\\"Demonstration of geographical features\\\",\\n        batch_source=my_db.table(\\\"sample_table\\\"),\\n    )\\n\\n    id = Int32().as_entity()\\n\\n    latitude1 = Float()\\n    longitude1 = Float()\\n    latitude2 = Float()\\n    longitude2 = Float()\\n\\n    coordinate1 = Coordinate(latitude1, longitude1)\\n    coordinate2 = Coordinate(latitude2, longitude2)\\n\\n    distance = coordinate1.eucledian_distance(coordinate2)\\n```\\n\\nThese examples demonstrate how to compute various types of features within the Aligned framework. By defining features in the FeatureView classes, you get a clear data model, typesafety, and code completion. This makes it easy to combine and extend features as needed.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":["import polars as
