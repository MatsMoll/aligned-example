# Aligned Examples

This repo contains differnet examples of how to use the `aligned` package.

## Whats included here
There are four differnet projects:
- New York taxi model - which predicts the duration of a trip.
- Titanic model - which predicts if a passenger survive.
- Question similarity model - Predicts which topic a question belongs to using text embeddings and a vector database.
- MNIST model - *beta feature* how to load raw data from a image model.

## Start the whole infrastructure
Aligned can do a lot of differnet things. Therefore, to make it simple to explore differnet parts of the stack, a Â´docker-compose.yaml` file has been created.

This will setup the following infrastructure:
- A data catalog to explore models, features, data lineage, and more - [Open the data catalog](http://localhost:8002)
- A stream worker that process data submitted through a redis stream - Exposes metrics on port 8000
- A features server that serves fresh features - [Open the feature server](http://localhost:8001)
- A redis instance that stores fresh features and as the messager for stream processing - Connect with `redis-cli -u redis://localhost:6378`
- A Prometheus server that presents metrics about the feature server, and stream worker process - [Open Prometheus UI](http://localhost:9090)

To start everything run `docker compose up`.

## Compared training pipeline
There will also be two different training pipelines that compute the same features, and perform roughly the same logic.

Both compute a XGBoost model that predicts the duration of a ride given features from the taxi dataset.
Here will both pipeline do the following:
- Load raw data from a `postgresql` database
- Compute streaming features (that are [point in time valid](https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/a-spark-join-operator-for-point-in-time-correct-joins))
- Validate the features - both schema and some minor semantics
- Perform a train test split based on time
- Train the model
- Compute mean absolute error and mean square error on the test set

To view the pipeline without `aligned` view [without_aligned_pipeline.py](without_aligned_pipeline.py), and with `aligned` view [with_aligned_pipeline.py](with_aligned_pipeline.py).

## Nice to know about `aligned`
Aligned works by describing our data logic into a format that any programming language can read. 
This means that `aligned` can choose spin up any feature we want, in any programming language we want, as long as we have the needed information.

Therefore, in this repo will we read a pre-compiled `JSON` file, and from here can we load, compute, validate, or do whatever we feel like with our features.

This also means that if you change any features in the `/examples` folder, will you need to recompile the features.
Thankfully can this be done with one command `aligned apply` - This expects that you have installed `aligned` which can be done through `pip install aligned`.
