## What and why should you use Aligned?

Aligned's goal is to reduce the technical debt in ML Systems. 

Aligned tries to address visiblity debt. Such debt makes it unclear how your system behave - Who writes, and who reads the data?
Aligned also fixes technical debt like dead code, as dead features can be pruned. This is possible by collecting data lineage of the whole system.

And much more! Read more about [debt in ML systems Sculley et al. [2015]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf).


Aligned is currently designed for low to medium sized companies. Therefore, Alinged only supports processing in Pandas and Polars, while Spark and Flink is not added, *yet*!

## Aligned Minimal Example

To view how the whole infrastructure can be started with minimal code. View the [Aligned Minimal Example repo](https://github.com/MatsMoll/aligned-example-minimal).
Here will the features in this repo be used as the source of truth (aka. the `feature-store.json` file), but only the infastructure will be defined there.

## Whats included here
There are four differnet projects:
- New York taxi model - which predicts the duration of a trip.
- Titanic model - which predicts if a passenger survive.
- Question similarity model - Predicts which topic a question belongs to using text embeddings and a vector database.
- MNIST model - *beta feature* how to load raw data from a image model.
- Credit Scoring - Almost the same as [Feast's Credit Scoring example](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast-aws-credit-scoring-tutorial/tree/main)

## Start the whole infrastructure
Aligned can do a lot of differnet things. Therefore, to make it simple to explore differnet parts of the stack, a Â´docker-compose.yaml` file has been created.

This will setup the following infrastructure:
- A data catalog to explore models, features, data lineage, and more - [Open the data catalog](http://localhost:8002)
- A stream worker that process data submitted through a redis stream - Exposes metrics on port 8000
- A features server that serves fresh features - [Open the feature server](http://localhost:8001)
- A redis instance that stores fresh features and as the messager for stream processing - Connect with `redis-cli -u redis://localhost:6378`
- A Prometheus server that presents metrics about the feature server, and stream worker process - [Open Prometheus UI](http://localhost:9090)

To start everything run `docker compose up`.

## Compared training pipeline
There will also be two different training pipelines that compute the same features, and perform roughly the same logic.

Both compute a XGBoost model that predicts the duration of a ride given features from the taxi dataset.
Here will both pipeline do the following:
- Load raw data from a `postgresql` database
- Compute streaming features (that are [point in time valid](https://www.hopsworks.ai/post/a-spark-join-operator-for-point-in-time-correct-joins))
- Validate the features - both schema and some minor semantics
- Perform a train test split based on time
- Train the model
- Compute mean absolute error and mean square error on the test set

To view the pipeline without `aligned` view [without_aligned_pipeline.py](without_aligned_pipeline.py), and with `aligned` view [with_aligned_pipeline.py](with_aligned_pipeline.py).

## Nice to know about `aligned`
Aligned works by describing our data logic into a format that any programming language can read. 
This means that `aligned` can choose spin up any feature we want, in any programming language we want, as long as we have the needed information.

Therefore, in this repo will we read a pre-compiled `JSON` file, and from here can we load, compute, validate, or do whatever we feel like with our features.

This also means that if you change any features in the `/examples` folder, will you need to recompile the features.
Thankfully can this be done with one command `aligned apply` - This expects that you have installed `aligned` which can be done through `pip install aligned`.
